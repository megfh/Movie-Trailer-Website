# Project: Movie Trailer Website

This project displays a web page allowing visitors to review some of my favourite movies and watch the trailers

The project consists of 3 files:
* media.py
* entertainment_center.py
* fresh_tomatoes.py (authored by Udacity)

To view the webpage:
* download all 3 files to the same folder
* in the command line, navigate to the folder containing the project files
* make sure you have Python installed on your computer (<https://www.python.org/>)
* run the command $ python entertainment_center.py
